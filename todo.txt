x get the gobin directory
x iterate through
x if it's not there, spit it out
x otherwise upgrade it. 
* if gobin is set, use it
* print an error if gomod is not set


I want to be able to update my go tools with the same one command ease as I do with brew

This means I need a registry somewhere of the tools I have installed

sounds like a go mod file


USAGE

`gobinup` update all installed go packages to the latest version


FACTS

* go get is the right way to do this
* it behaves differently in mod mode and gopath mode
* the basic way you get something is `go get golang.org/x/tools/gopls`


You can set mod mode with GO111MODULE=on and use `go get` outside of a package. 

then, `go version -m $(go env GOPATH)/bin/goimports` will get you the package import path.
